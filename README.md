# Hi, I'm Mahmudul Hasan Mridul 👋

Welcome to my digital portfolio! This isn't just a collection of code—it's a curated showcase of my journey as a **Founder**, **Visual Storyteller**, and **Creative Director**.

I built this site to bridge the gap between my technical projects and my artistic ventures. Whether it's leading a fashion startup like **Noore**, capturing architectural stills through **Mahmudul's Photographs**, or building communities like **Haven Of Handwriters**, I believe in crafting experiences that leave a mark.

## What's Inside?

This portfolio is a React-based application designed to be as dynamic and vibrant as the work it holds.

-   **The Visual Vault**: A deep dive into my photography and graphic design work (check out the `Creatives` section), optimized for speed and quality.
-   **Chronology of Impact**: An interactive timeline of my leadership roles and organizations (`Experience.tsx`).
-   **Deep Linking**: Shareable links for every section, so you can point people exactly where you want them to go.
-   **Mobile First**: A fully responsive experience that looks great on your phone (check out the new mobile footer!).

## Tech Under the Hood

I wanted this site to feel premium and fast, so I used:

-   **React & TypeScript**: For a robust, type-safe foundation.
-   **Vite**: For lightning-fast builds and hot reloading.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: For bespoke styling, glassmorphism effects, and smooth animations.
-   **Python Optimization**: I even wrote a custom Python script to automatically compress and convert all high-res assets to WebP, ensuring the site loads instantly without losing visual fidelity.

## Let's Connect!

I'm always open to discussing new ideas, collaborations, or just chatting about design and technology.
